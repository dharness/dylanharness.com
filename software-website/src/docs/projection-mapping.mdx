Simulate 3D worlds with 2D assets.

<div style={{ borderRadius: "100px" }}>
  <iframe
    title="vimeo-player"
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/851113003?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&loop=1"
    width="640"
    height="360"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

I used projection mapping as a technique for simulating 3D worlds with 2D assets. The scene was drawn first in 2D and a reference plane was determined with fSpy.
